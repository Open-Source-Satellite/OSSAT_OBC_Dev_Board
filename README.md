## Background


## Running the OSSAT OBC Application
At the point our first mission has been flying for 1 year, the OSSAT OBC Application software will become open source. In the interim time, in order to develop/build and run the OSSAT OBC Application, you'll need to become an OSSAT collaborator (see [Get Involved](#get-involved])).
If you are an OSSAT collaborator, that great... Click [here](/OBC_CODE_README.md) to find out how to run the OSSAT OBC Application on this development board.
