## Background
The key drivers for the Open Source Satellite (OSSAT) are to improve the affordability, accessibility and
sustainability of space; to address the market need for an improvement in the
price:performance point of small satellites; to stimulate the next wave of disruption
in the small satellite industry; and to enable the development of new missions,
applications and services.

</p>
Small satellites initiated the initial market
disruption by leveraging COTS parts and
processes, but it appears that the unit cost
per spacecraft cannot be reduced much
further.  
Cubesats have been critical in recent years for
lowering the barriers to entry, however they
appear to be unable to provide sufficient
robustness and mission enabling capability to
support more demanding missions.  
The goal is to develop OSSAT to fill this gap and deliver microsatellite-class
performance for a cubesat price, even when manufacturing in low volumes. The
aim is to increase the level of integration and robustness over subsequent missions
in order to develop a single platform that is affordable for use in vLEO (very low
Earth orbit) (low Earth orbit), GEO (Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit), lunar and
interplanetary missions.  
OSSAT will be a performant and flexible
system that KISPE Space will be able to use to implement some of its own
commercial missions; however, simply using it for KISPE Space missions will not
result in the desired increase in accessibility to the design, nor stimulate the
market.  
Making the OSSAT design open source will maximise access and achieve the wider aims of The
Programme.  

## Running the OSSAT OBC Application
Within one year of the first launch of the OSSAT, the OSSAT OBC Application software will become open source. In the interim time, in order to develop/build and run the OSSAT OBC Application, you'll need to become an OSSAT collaborator (see [Get Involved](#get-involved])).
If you are an OSSAT collaborator, that's great... Click [here](/OBC_CODE_README.md) to find out how to run the OSSAT OBC Application on this development board.
