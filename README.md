# Open Source Satellite Development On Board Computer
An Open Source Program that allows users to interact with a Spacecraft in a lab environment, pre-launch. 

For those who are new to the Space Industry and it's terminology, please refer to the [Background](#Background) section.
Also refer to the [OSSAT Glossary](/OSSAT%20Glossary.pdf) for explanations of any terminology.  
Otherwise, head to [User Setup](#user-setup) if you want to use the software, or [Development Setup](#development-setup) if you want to develop.

**NOTE: This software is useful for lab testing a spacecraft, pre-launch. Different software would be used to communicate with the spacecraft in orbit. The communications protocol is not suitable for in-orbit communication, see [The Spec](/OSSAT%20Mercury%20GS%20Specification_08.pdf) for further details.**

## Background


## Running the OSSAT OBC Application
At the point our first mission has been flying for 1 year, the OSSAT OBC Application software will become open source. In the interim time, in order to develop/build and run the OSSAT OBC Application, you'll need to become an OSSAT collaborator (see [Get Involved](#get-involved])).
If you are an OSSAT collaborator, that great... Click [here](/OBC_CODE_README.md) to find out how to run the OSSAT OBC Application on this development board.
